Absolute TODOs:
- thread protection, reentrancy, refcounting, etc ...

TODO:
- Create() API, how do we best keep flexibility and allow various
  specific environment and space for evolution (VMX)
- track change of xend API & XML-RPC
- API for the Node: extracting informations, selecting scheduling policy
- better resources allocation APIs (%CPU, set memory)
- DTD/RNG/XSD schemas for the XML Domain descriptions
- in python bindings raise an exception if a lookup or connection fails
  to return a non-None object
- Add uuid to XML format
- add error handling hooks at the python level

virsh TODO:
- decide where will be default directory for domains configurations (/etc/xen/domains/* ?)
- new cmd: create new domain by config file (like "xm create")
      create [--conf /path/file.conf | name]
- new cmd: print info about domain configuration:
      cinfo [--conf /path/file.conf | name] 
- new cmd: print list of all domains configurations:
      clist [--dir /path]
- new cmd: print info about saved domain image:
      sinfo /path/domain.img

Probable TODOs:
- event on big domain state change (create, crashed, paused, shutdown, destroy)
- bindings for more languages

Would-be-nice TODO:
- man page for virsh and the libraries entry points
- support for QEmu and other virtualization engines
- more documentation and examples on using the toolkit
- examples and docs for the principle in the error handling code

Cleanup:
- now that libxml2 is linked in, drop hash.[ch] and get back to libxml2 ones ?
  same for the buffers 

Done:
- make dist and make rpm targets
- set a no public by default policy for libvir symbols
- fix the python bindings
- renamed to libvirt
- the CreateLinux() API is a first step toward a final Create()
- documentation and examples on using the toolkit
- UUID based lookup and naming
- Error API similar to libxml2 structured API
- extract error messages from the Xend rpc
