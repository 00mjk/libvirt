      <dd>
        Archipel is a libvirt-based solution to manage and supervise virtual
        machines.  It uses XMPP for all communication. There is no web
        service or custom protocol.  You just need at least one XMPP server,
        like eJabberd, to start playing with it.  This allows Archipel to
        work completely real time.  You never have to refresh the user
        interface, you'll be notified as soon as something happens. You can
        even use your favorite chat clients to command your infrastructure.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        Isn't it great to be able to open a chat conversation with your
        virtual machine and say things like "How are you today?" or "Hey,
        please reboot"?

        Guestfish is an interactive shell and command-line tool for examining
        and modifying virtual machine filesystems.  It uses libvirt to find
        guests and their associated disks.

      <dt>virsh</dt>
      <dd>
        An interactive shell, and batch scriptable tool for performing
        management tasks on all libvirt managed domains, networks and
        storage. This is part of the libvirt core distribution.

      <dt><a href="http://virt-manager.org/">virt-clone</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Allows the disk image(s) and configuration for an existing
        virtual machine to be cloned to form a new virtual machine.
        It automates copying of data across to new disk images, and
        updates the UUID, MAC address, and name in the configuration.

      <dd>
        Examine the utilization of each filesystem in a virtual machine
        from the comfort of the host machine. This tool peeks into the
        guest disks and determines how much space is used. It can cope
        with common Linux filesystems and LVM volumes.
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="http://virt-manager.org/">virt-image</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Provides a way to deploy virtual appliances. It defines a
        simplified portable XML format describing the pre-requisites
        of a virtual machine. At time of deployment this is translated
        into the domain XML format for execution under any libvirt
        hypervisor meeting the pre-requisites.
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="http://virt-manager.org/">virt-install</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Provides a way to provision new virtual machines from a
        OS distribution install tree. It supports provisioning from
        local CD images, and the network over NFS, HTTP and FTP.

        machine, using a rescue CD.

      <dt><a href="http://et.redhat.com/~rjones/virt-p2v/">virt-p2v</a></dt>
      <dd>
        An older tool for converting a physical machine into a virtual
        machine.  It is a LiveCD which is booted on the machine to be
        converted.  It collects a little information from the user, then
        copies the disks over to a remote machine and defines the XML for a
        domain to run the guest.
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=virt-v2v.git;a=summary">virt-v2v</a></dt>
      <dd>
        virt-v2v converts guests from a foreign hypervisor to run on KVM,
        managed by libvirt.  It can currently convert Red Hat Enterprise
        Linux (RHEL) and Fedora guests running on Xen and VMware ESX.  It
        will enable VirtIO drivers in the converted guest if possible.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        For RHEL customers of Red Hat, conversion of Windows guests is also
        possible.  This conversion requires some Microsoft signed pieces,
        that Red Hat can provide.
