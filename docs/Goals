         Why libxen:
	 -----------


  The main goals of the library is to provide an stable API abstracting
the underlying acual implementation of the hypervisor calls.

1/ Stable API:
   by isolating the data structures and entry points used at the low
   level Xen Hypervisor interfaces, allowing evolution of said interface
   over time without breaking the application visible API and ABI

2/ Abstraction:
   by providing at the C level simplified concept exposed only as opaque
   structure for the hypervisor connection, domains and other kind of
   objects which may be needed in the future. It must also provide
   a set of higher level function calls simplifying the developement
   of applications using the supervisor.

3/ Maintainability and openness:
   All data structures and entry points must be fully documented, all
   changes will be driven in an open fashion based on a publicly archived
   mailing-list allowing peer-review before changes will be introduced.
   Tools and regression tests will be implemented and shipped as part of the
   releases of the library.
