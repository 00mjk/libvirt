# Master configuration file for the virt-login-shell program.
# All settings described here are optional - if omitted, sensible
# defaults are used.

# By default, virt-login-shell will connect you to a container running
# with the /bin/sh program.  Modify the shell variable if you want your
# users to run a different shell or a setup container when joining a
# container.
#
# This can either be just the path to a shell binary:
#
# shell = "/bin/bash"
#
# Or can be the path and extra arguments
#
# shell = [ "/bin/bash", "--posix" ]
#
# Note there is no need to pass a '--login' / '-l' argument since
# virt-login-shell will always request a login shell

# allowed_users specifies the user names of all users that are allowed to
# execute virt-login-shell.  You can specify the users as a comma
# separated list of usernames or user groups.
# The list of names support glob syntax.
# To disallow all users (default)
# allowed_users = []
# If you do not specify any names (default) then no one is allowed
# to use this executable.
# To allow fred and joe only
# allowed_users = ["fred", "joe"]
# To allow all users within a specific group prefix the group name with %.
# allowed_users = ["%engineers"]
# To allow all users specify the following
# allowed_users = [ "*" ]
